## Install

Requires Node.js 8.10+.

```
npm install did-io
```

## Usage

### Requiring did-io (Node.js / npm)

```js
const dids = require('did-io');
```

### Setting up a Private Key Store

DIDs are essentially repositories of public keys on various networks / ledgers.
Any non-trivial operations that involve them, such as registering, updating,
authenticating and so on, necessarily involve working with corresponding private
keys.

To aid with experimentation and development of DID-related prototypes, `did-io`
uses a simple filesystem based JSON blob storage system, to store private keys
and DID metadata on one's local machine.

Keys from DID Documents (as well as related metadata) you control will be stored
in the `~/.dids` folder by default.

### Veres One Ledger Usage

See the [Veres One Method spec](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/didm-veres-one/) for
context.

```js
const v1 = dids.methods.veres();
```

#### Retrieving a Veres One DID Document

```js
const did = 'did:v1:test:nym:QdF43dq9Qu5HrDcMq91hebewWK5bvVWQ4CeyRrQ5Ydq';
const didDocResult = await v1.get(did);
// didDocResult:
{
  found: true,
  retry: false,
  type: 'LedgerDidDocument',
  did: 'did:v1:test:nym:QdF43dq9Qu5HrDcMq91hebewWK5bvVWQ4CeyRrQ5Ydq',
  doc: {
    object: {
      '@context': 'https://w3id.org/veres-one/v1',
      id: 'did:v1:test:nym:QdF43dq9Qu5HrDcMq91hebewWK5bvVWQ4CeyRrQ5Ydq',
      authentication: [...],
      grantCapability: [...],
      invokeCapability: [...]
    },
    meta: {
      blockHeight: 109,
      created: 1522177961881,
      updated: 1522177961881,
      sequence: 0
    }
  }
}
```

#### Generating a Veres One DID Document

Note: This also saves the generated keys in `dids.keyStore`.

```js
const didDocument = await v1.generate({ passphrase: null });
```

#### Registering a (newly generated) DID Document

To register a DID Document using an Equihash proof of work:

```js
const result = await v1.register({ didDocument });
```

To register using an Accelerator:

```js
const accelerator = 'genesis.testnet.veres.one';
const authDoc = didDocumentFromAccelerator; // obtained previously

const result = await v1.register({ didDocument, accelerator, authDoc });
```
