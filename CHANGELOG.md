# did-io ChangeLog

## 3.0.0 -

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: `parseDid` no longer returns `prefix`. Returns `method` instead.

### Added
- **BREAKING**: `CachedResolver` now validates DIDs before resolving them.
- `CachedResolver.use` now accepts a second optional method parameter.
- Tests were added for the new validators.

## 2.0.0 - 2022-06-02

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Convert to module (ESM).
- **BREAKING**: Require Node.js >=14.
- Update dependencies.
- Lint module.

## 1.1.0 - 2021-11-30

### Added
- Add `resolver.generate()` pass-through function.

## 1.0.0 - 2021-04-06

This version is a major breaking release, based on cumulative experience in
the field with DID method drivers. See Upgrading from `8.x` section for
instructions.

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Rename NPM package name from `did-io` to `@digitalbazaar/did-io`.
- **BREAKING**: `.use()` no longer requires a method id first param. New usage:
  `.use(driver)`.
- Add a `CachedResolver` class (extracted from `did:key` method driver) to
  server as the driver harness.
- **BREAKING**: Change module export signature. (see Upgrading section below
  on usage.)
- **BREAKING**: No longer export a `DidDocument` class. DID documents are now
  expected to be plain JS/parsed JSON objects, instead of `DidDocument`
  instances.

### Upgrading from `8.x`

See [Upgrading v0.8 to v1.0.0 checklist](docs/upgrading-0.8-to-1.0.md) in `docs/`.

## 0.8.3 - 2020-08-19

### Fixed
- Engine specification format in package.json (Node 12+).

## 0.8.2 - 2020-05-12

- Add a `forceConstruct` optimization flag.

## 0.8.0 - 2020-04-10

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Update API to Chai-like `dids.use(method, driver)` architecture
  (no methods will be bundled with did-io by default).
- **BREAKING**: Updated terminology to match latest VeresOne DID method specs:
  `grantCapability -> capabilityDelegation`,
  `invokeCapability -> capabilityInvocation`
- **BREAKING**: Renamed `secretKey` to `privateKey`, to match Digital
  Bazaar conventions. (Migrating from v0.7.0 will require renaming the relevant properties in existing DID Docs.)
